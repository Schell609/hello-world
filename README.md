# hello-world Web developer/problem solver

I am a web developer and Entrepreneur. I absolutely love building startups, creating content, and marketing. I focus on putting clients and their business first. Using technology and code as tools to solve their problem. My sole purpose is to make my clients profit or to save them money.

Our freedom to operate and maneuver had increased substantially through disciplined procedures. Discipline equals freedom. Joco willink
